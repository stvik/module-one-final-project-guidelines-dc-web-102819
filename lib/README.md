# Welcome to your New Life!

This a 'choose your own adventure' game based on careers. The fist thing you have to do is give your character a name and gender. Then you start off at the age of 18 and choose your career from three choices: construction, medicine, or politics. Each career decision will lead you to new choices, where your happiness and money can either increase or decrease. You win by reaching the retirement age of 78 without your money or happiness dipping below 0. If your happiness or money dips below zero, you lose. Choose wisely!

After you finish the game, you can either choose to play again, view the leaderboard, or quit.
